## Core Objectives Met

1. When a user adds a database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize. 
2. When a user enters schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
3. When a user enters the command to invoke the application, their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
4. When a user opens API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags,the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
5. When a user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in their database.
